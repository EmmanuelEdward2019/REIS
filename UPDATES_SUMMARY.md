# 🛠️ Updates Completed

## 1. Consultation Form Implemented
- Created a reusable `ConsultationModal` component.
- **Fields**: Name, Email, Phone, Area of Interest (Pre-filled based on page), and Project Details.
- **Integration**: 
  - Added to all **REIS Pages** (via `SolutionPage.tsx`).
  - Added to **Data & AI Page** (`DataAI.tsx`).
  - Triggered by "Schedule Consultation", "Get Started", and "Start Your Project" buttons.

## 2. Visual Refinements
- **Blue Buttons**: Changed the text color of "Learn More" and "View Case Studies" buttons in the hero sections to a vibrant blue (`text-blue-400`) for better visibility.
- **Hero Gradient**: Fixed the "dusty" look in the Data & AI hero section by adding a solid bottom gradient that blends seamlessly into the content.

## 3. Fixes
- **File Restoration**: Restored the corrupted `SolutionPage.tsx` file which was causing a syntax error. It is now fully functional with the new premium design.
