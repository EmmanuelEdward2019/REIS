# 🔗 Navigation Updates

## Data & AI Page Links
The buttons on the `/data-and-ai` page have been updated to improve navigation flow:

1.  **"View Case Studies"** (Hero Section)
    -   **Action**: Now navigates to the **Projects** page (`/projects`).
    -   **Purpose**: Allows users to see real-world examples of your work immediately.

2.  **"Explore Solutions"** (CTA Section)
    -   **Action**: Now navigates to the **Services** page (`/services`).
    -   **Purpose**: Guides users to explore your broader service offerings if they aren't ready to schedule a consultation yet.

These changes ensure that users have clear pathways to relevant content, increasing engagement and reducing bounce rates.
